Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helps us to get the most important parts of the data out of huge datasets. In other words, PCA is reducing the number of irrelevant variables and we can get a much readable dataset to derive some patterns. On the other hand, the more we reduce our data, we get less precise perspectives.
